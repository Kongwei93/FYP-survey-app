          text: `The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of
          stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in oneâ€™s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to
          tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of
          direct queries about current levels of experienced stress.  The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the 
          last month. In each case, respondents areasked how often they felt a certain way.`,

          20-item measure that asks caregivers to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated 
          with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 
          for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 
          3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.`,
