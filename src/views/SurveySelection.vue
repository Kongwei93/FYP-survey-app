          stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in oneâ€™s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to
          tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of
          direct queries about current levels of experienced stress.  The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the 
          last month. In each case, respondents areasked how often they felt a certain way.`,
