    Load the recaptcha library asynchronously to not block the main JS app from loading
    <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?render=6Lcex6QcAAAAADus4RtnoqwskQoXcB2DwgCav11Z" async defer>

    However that causes an issue where the library might be loaded after the main app runs
    And if running the cancel appointment app, and the cancel appointment effect runs, it will fail as grecaptcha is not defined yet
    Thus this is loaded synchronously asap

    Here is a solution to use if the library should be loaded asynchronously inside the JS module
